# ADK Command Compatibility Verification

This document verifies that all agents in the canonical structure can be discovered and executed using ADK commands.

## Test Results

All the following ADK commands have been tested and work correctly:

### 1. Video Orchestrator (Main Pipeline)
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/video_orchestrator
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes the main orchestration pipeline

### 2. Research Agent
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/research_agent
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes individual research agent

### 3. Story Agent
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/story_agent
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes individual story agent

### 4. Asset Sourcing Agent
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/asset_sourcing_agent
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes individual asset sourcing agent

### 5. Image Generation Agent
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/image_generation_agent
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes individual image generation agent

### 6. Audio Agent
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/audio_agent
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes individual audio agent

### 7. Video Assembly Agent
```bash
adk run video_system/agents/video_assembly_agent
```
✅ **Status**: Working - Executes individual video assembly agent

## Summary

- **Total Agents Tested**: 7
- **Successfully Working**: 7
- **Success Rate**: 100%

All agents are properly structured following ADK's canonical pattern and can be discovered and executed by ADK tooling.

## Requirements Satisfied

This verification satisfies the following requirements:

- **Requirement 6.1**: ADK commands can discover and load all properly structured agents
- **Requirement 6.2**: `adk run video_orchestrator` executes the main video generation pipeline
- **Requirement 6.3**: Individual agents can be run independently using ADK commands
- **Requirement 6.4**: All agents are accessible through ADK's standard interfaces
- **Requirement 6.5**: The system uses ADK's standard deployment patterns

## Notes
- All agents start successfully and are discovered by ADK
- The canonical structure is properly implemented
- Import paths have been fixed to work with ADK's discovery mechanism
- Each agent defines the required `root_agent` variable
- All `__init__.py` files contain the proper `from . import agent` import
