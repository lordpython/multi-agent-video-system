# Comprehensive Error Handling Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive error handling implementation for the session management unification system, addressing Task 5 requirements for robust error handling, graceful degradation, retry mechanisms, and proper monitoring.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Session-Specific Error Handling (`session_error_handling.py`)

#### Error Types and Hierarchy
- **SessionError**: Base class for all session-related errors
- **SessionServiceUnavailableError**: When SessionService is unavailable
- **SessionNotFoundError**: When a session doesn't exist
- **SessionStorageCorruptedError**: When session storage is corrupted
- **SessionConcurrentAccessError**: When concurrent access causes conflicts

#### Key Features
- Structured error information with error codes, categories, and severity levels
- Proper error serialization for logging and API responses
- Context-aware error messages with session IDs and operation details

### 2. Retry Mechanisms

#### Session Retry Decorator (`@session_retry`)
- Configurable retry attempts (default: 3)
- Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Smart retry logic that doesn't retry certain errors (e.g., SessionNotFoundError)
- Comprehensive logging of retry attempts

#### Retry Configuration
```python
class SessionRetryConfig:
    max_attempts: int = 3
    base_delay: float = 1.0
    max_delay: float = 30.0
    exponential_base: float = 2.0
    jitter: bool = True
    backoff_strategy: str = "exponential"
```

### 3. Fallback Mechanisms

#### SessionFallbackManager
- Automatic fallback from primary service to in-memory service
- Health tracking of primary service availability
- Seamless switching between services
- Recovery detection when primary service becomes available

#### Fallback Operations
- Session creation with fallback support
- Session retrieval with fallback support
- Session updates with fallback support
- Session deletion with fallback support

### 4. Concurrent Access Protection

#### Session-Level Locking
- Individual locks for each session to prevent concurrent modifications
- Registry-level locking for session listing operations
- Deadlock prevention through proper lock ordering
- Automatic cleanup of session locks when sessions are deleted

### 5. Health Monitoring

#### SessionHealthMonitor
- Real-time tracking of operation success/failure rates
- Response time monitoring with rolling averages
- Service availability determination based on success rates
- Comprehensive health status reporting

#### Health Metrics
- Total operations count
- Success/failure rates
- Average response times
- Last error information
- Service availability status

### 6. Enhanced Session Manager

#### VideoSystemSessionManager Enhancements
- Comprehensive error handling for all operations
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Fallback service integration
- Health monitoring integration
- Concurrent access protection
- Graceful degradation capabilities

#### Key Methods Enhanced
- `create_session()`: With retry, fallback, and validation
- `get_session()`: With fallback and proper error handling
- `update_session_state()`: With concurrent access protection
- `delete_session()`: With cleanup and error recovery
- `list_sessions()`: With stale entry cleanup
- `cleanup_expired_sessions()`: With comprehensive error handling

### 7. Orchestration Error Handling

#### Enhanced Orchestration Functions
- Input validation for all parameters
- Retry logic for session operations
- Graceful error handling with proper logging
- Session state updates with error information
- Standardized error response formats

#### Error Recovery Utilities
- `handle_orchestration_error()`: Centralized error handling
- `validate_session_exists()`: Session validation utility
- Comprehensive logging with context information

## Error Handling Patterns

### 1. Graceful Degradation
When primary services fail:
- Automatic fallback to in-memory storage
- Continued operation with reduced functionality
- Clear indication of degraded mode
- Automatic recovery when services restore

### 2. Retry with Backoff
For transient failures:
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Configurable retry attempts
- Smart retry decisions based on error type
- Comprehensive retry logging

### 3. Circuit Breaker Pattern
For service protection:
- Failure threshold monitoring
- Automatic service isolation
- Recovery timeout mechanisms
- Health status tracking

### 4. Concurrent Access Handling
For data consistency:
- Session-level locking
- Registry-level protection
- Deadlock prevention
- Lock cleanup on errors

## Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
The implementation includes a comprehensive test suite (`test_comprehensive_error_handling.py`) that validates:

1. **Session Creation Retry**: Tests retry logic with failing services
2. **Fallback Mechanism**: Tests automatic fallback to in-memory service
3. **Concurrent Access Protection**: Tests session-level locking
4. **Error Recovery Scenarios**: Tests various error conditions
5. **Orchestration Error Handling**: Tests orchestration-level error handling
6. **Health Monitoring**: Tests health status and monitoring
7. **Graceful Degradation**: Tests system behavior under failure conditions

### Test Results
All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:
- ✅ Retry mechanisms work correctly
- ✅ Fallback services activate properly
- ✅ Concurrent access is protected
- ✅ Error recovery scenarios handled
- ✅ Health monitoring functions correctly
- ✅ Graceful degradation works as expected

## Configuration Options

### Error Handling Configuration
```python
VideoSystemSessionManager(
    session_service=primary_service,
    enable_fallback=True,           # Enable fallback service
    retry_config=SessionRetryConfig(
        max_attempts=3,             # Maximum retry attempts
        base_delay=1.0,            # Base delay between retries
        max_delay=30.0,            # Maximum delay cap
        exponential_base=2.0,      # Exponential backoff base
        jitter=True                # Add jitter to prevent thundering herd
    )
)
```

### Health Monitoring Configuration
```python
# Health check thresholds
SUCCESS_RATE_THRESHOLD = 0.8    # 80% success rate for healthy status
SLOW_OPERATION_THRESHOLD = 5.0  # 5 seconds for slow operation warning
MAX_RESPONSE_TIMES = 100        # Keep last 100 response times for averaging
```

## Monitoring and Observability

### Structured Logging
- All errors logged with structured JSON format
- Context information included (session IDs, operations, timing)
- Severity levels properly assigned
- Error correlation through operation IDs

### Health Status API
```python
# Get comprehensive health status
health_status = await session_manager.get_health_status()

# Force health check with operation tests
health_check = await session_manager.force_health_check()
```

### Metrics Collection
- Operation counts and success rates
- Response time distributions
- Error categorization and trending
